==== RUST ====
Welcome to my presentation!
Today's discussion will include:
* What is systems programming?
* What is memory safety?
* What is Rust?
* How can Rust help me write better code?
* What are some of Rust's cool features?
---
Oh, and this presentation is open source!
So is the software that I'm using to present.
So are my other presentations for this club.

==== SYSTEMS PROGRAMMING ====
* Systems programming works with the OS.
* Generally less client-focused.
* Needs to be performant.
* Languages like C and C++.
* Generally harder to work with.
    * Take more planning.
    * Require more knowledge of memory.
* But, significantly faster than scripting languages.
---
==== RUST ====
* Rust is a new(er) systems programming language.
* Created in 2010 by employees at Mozilla Research.
* Notably used in Firefox Servo browser.
* "Most Loved" language for the past six years.
* Focus on "safety".
    * All variables are immutable by default.
    * Rust provides memory safety.
    * Rust has atomic types for safe concurrency.
---
==== MEMORY LEAKS ====
* Memory always needs to be freed.
* C's solution: manual memory management.
* Java's solution: garbage collection.
---
==== MANUAL MEMORY MANAGEMENT ====
* When you allocate memory, you need to return it.
* Use `malloc()` to allocate.
* Use `free()` to free.
$nvim manual.c
$./manual
* Easy, right?
---
==== MANUAL MEMORY MANAGEMENT: PROS AND CONS ====
* Incredible speed.
* Gives the programmer the most control.
* But, don't forget a single `free()`
* You do all the work.
* Do you really trust yourself to remember that?
---
==== GARBAGE COLLECTION ====
* The runtime handles memory.
* Watches for who needs data.
* Once the data is unused, deallocates for you.
$nvim Gc.java
$java Gc
* See, much easier!
---
==== GARBAGE COLLECTION: PROS AND CONS ====
* Very easy on the programmer.
* Prevents memory leaks.
* Sloooooooooooow.
* Tons of overhead.
---
==== A THIRD METHOD? ====
* In most cases, we do not need GC.
* But we also don't want to go full manual.
---
==== RAII ====
* Find lifetime of every variable at compile time.
* Compiler fills in the blanks.
* Memory safety with less overhead than GC.
$nvim raii.rs
$./raii
* Looks high-level, actually very performant.
---
==== NULL POINTERS ====
* Null pointers are a massive pain point.
"I call it my billion-dollar mistake. It was the invention of the null
"reference. At that time, I was designing the first comprehensive type system
"for references in an object oriented language. My goal was to ensure that all
"use of references should be absolutely safe... but I couldn't resist the
"temptation to put in a null reference. This has led to innumerable errors,
"vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion
"dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years.
"- Sir Tony Hoare
---
==== NULL POINTERS (cont.) ====
* The answer is obvous, right?
* Just have references that can't be null!
* The industry is years behind on this.
* Rust has no nullable references.
---
==== DATA RACES ====
* Imagine the following:
    * Resource R is initialized.
    * Thread A gets reference to R.
    * Thread B also gets a reference.
    * Thread A begins an operation on R.
    * Thread B requests information from R.
* This can lead to unexpected results.
* Happens in single-threaded programs as well.
---
==== DATA RACE MITIGATION ====
* Mutexes help for multi-threaded.
* C++ invalidates iterators.
* C makes you figure it out by yourself.
* Rust's solution: Ownership.
---
==== OWNERSHIP ====
* Every resource is owned by one function.
* When you pass resource R in:
    * Ownership is transferred to callee.
    * Caller cannot access R after call.
* When you pass reference to R:
    * Ownership is not transferred.
    * Callee borrows R.
    * Caller can access R after call.
---
==== OWNERSHIP IN ACTION ====
$nvim move.rs
$rustc move.rs
* This code doesn't compile
$nvim borrow.rs
$./borrow
* This code works!
---
==== OTHER COOL THINGS ====
* Reference-counted types
    * Do borrow checking at runtime.
* Enum types
    * May encapsulate one of several types.
    * Keeps a flag for what types exist.
* Option<T>
    * Type that can be Some or None
    * Safe version of nullable references.
* Result<T, E>
    * Rust's way to handle errors.
    * Functions that may have an error return Result.
    * Result is either Ok(T) or Err(E).
    * Handle things differently depending on return.
* Cargo
    * Rust's build system.
    * Automatically grab packages from crates.io.
    * Easy to set up a project.
    * Comes with a testing framework.
* LSP support
    * Write Rust in your favorite editor with completion.
* And more!
