# FSLC Presentations

This repository contains
my personal stash of presentations
for the [Utah State University Free Software and Linux Club](https://linux.usu.edu),
of which I am the president
(as of time of writing).

The earlier presentations
were written in a custom format
and presented using a custom
terminal-based slideshow program
included in this repository
written in POSIX shell.

The later presentations
(as well as later revisions
of earlier presentations)
instead rely on [slides](https://github.com/maaslalani/slides),
a program which I have become rather fond of
which provides a similar terminal-based presentation format
but which is much more developed.

The older ones
(including init systems and software minimalism)
are kind of terrible.
The newer ones
and ones that have been updated more recently
(including Rust and SSH)
are probably okay.

## Presentations and Dates

I believe this is a fairly comprehensive list
of my past presentations.
If the presentation
is or was shown using this repository,
the relevant commit is linked.
